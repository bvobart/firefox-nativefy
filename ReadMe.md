# `firefox-nativefy.sh`

Want have a website as a desktop application? But is there no official application available (for Linux)? And do you want to avoid Chrome / Electron?

Here's `firefox-nativefy.sh`: a simple Bash script to help you nativefy websites.

## Usage

```sh
# WhatsApp, Telegram and Notion are automatically detected to have correct names
./firefox-nativefy web.whatsapp.com
```

## TODO

- Supplying custom icon probably doesn't work as expected (and is undocumented)
